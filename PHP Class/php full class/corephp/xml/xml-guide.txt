xml stands for (xtensible markup language)
   it has nothing as predefined
   all is depend on user defined tags.
   but all user defined tags are case sencitive
   every xml should have a parent tag. but only one 
   child tag has no limitation
   xml use to store the data same like mysql.
   but it is not secure and not suitable for bulk storage like mysql.
