	<p> TNN | Mar 28, 2018, 21:10 IST</p>
	<p style="background-color:white;">
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (MMRDA) failure to recover lease premium on schedule resulted in non-recovery of Rs 866 crore, states the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report 2017 tabled in both houses on the last day of the state legislature.
	In 2008 the state urban development department announced an increase in floor space index for residential (from 1 to 3) and commercial (2 to 4) exploitation in the G Block in the Bandra-Kurla Complex. This resulted in an additional Built Up Area of 13 lakh sq metres becoming available 
	in G Block. This was made available to existing allottees at 100 and 150% respectively of the Ready Reckoner Rate as a one-time scheme.
	As per the scheme, 20% of the premium was to be paid along with demand letter before March 2009 (revised to March 2010 and further revised to March 2011) and rest in four annual instalments with 10 per cent simple interest. The delay in payment of annual instalment would attract delayed interest at 14%. There was no time limit specified for consumption of the additional BUA.

    The CAG studied two cases and found that M/s Reliance Industry that was allotted an additional BUA of 67,000 sq metres for Rs 985 crore did not adhere to the time schedule for instalment payment. By March 2016, the sum had touched Rs 1,340 crore but the allottee had paid only Rs 697 crore.

		<section style="background-color:white;margin: 0px 0px 0px 500px;">All you need to know about who needs to write the exam, what next and possible roll back
		New Delhi: Central Board of Secondary Education, CBSE taking cognizance of reports of the paper 
		leak today afternoon issued a notice announcing the re-examination of Mathematics paper for class 
		10th and economics examination of class 12th board examinations 2018. Immediately after the rollout 
		of the news reactions of parents, students, teachers and celebrities started to flood the internet.
		As the WhatsApp groups activated with the news more information started to flood. But what next? 
		Who all need to write the exam? Does it apply to students outside Delhi as well? Is there a rollback?
		These are the questions that are worrying people the most and we have tried to answer them here.</section>
	    <td style="background-color:white;">
		Who all need to appear in the CBSE class 10 and 12 Re-examination?
		Starting off with the basics – to all who are concerned, CBSE conducts only one examination for All India and Delhi Region. Till last year the papers used to be different. However, from this year, the question papers for pan India are same. In effect, the decision to conduct a re-examination applies to all the candidates who have written the examination. For all the regions – Delhi as 
		well as every other state. HRD Minister has confirmed in the press conference that the re-examination is for all.
		
		Though it has been confirmed by Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar that the instance of the leak was reported from a few regions in Delhi, the impact of the retest is pan India. All the students who have enrolled for CBSE Board Examinations 2018 and have written the Mathematics and Economics paper for Class 10 and 12 are required to appear in the re-examination. For all practical purposes, students can understand that the paper conducted today for Class 10 mathematics and the paper conducted on March 26 for class 12 economics now stands cancelled. Also read | CBSE Class 10 and 12 paper leak: PM Narendra Modi expresses unhappiness, seeks strict action

		<tr ><p style="background-color:white;margin: 0px 0px 0px 500px;">What next?
		The other big question for students and parents is what next. The answer, though painful, is fairly simple. The students and parents are required to keep a lookout for the schedule of the re-examination. The dates of the re-examination would be announced by the CBSE before the end of the week. Experts are suggesting that though there is no precedence, in all probability CBSE may conduct the Class 10 mathematics paper by April 6 and Class 12 Economics paper by April 14 or 17. As to the exact date, there is no confirmation yet.

		“In the normal course of events, CBSE Class 10 board examinations 2018 were scheduled to end on April 4 with Painting and the last exam for CBSE Class 12 was of Physical Education on April 13. CBSE in all probability would conduct the re-examination only after the end of the normal scheduled examinations. As to paper setting and printing, that should not be a problem.” Another expert agreed. However, the board would be deciding the dates and releasing them shortly. In the meanwhile, all the teachers have urged the students not to get disheartened or lose hope and keep the preperations on.

		  <p >No extension of time for linking Aadhaar to welfare schemes: Supreme Court
          1 DAY AGOThe top court had on March 13 extended indefinitely the March 31 deadline for linking bank accounts and mobile phone numbers with Aadhaar.

		 Whistleblower says the company ‘worked extensively’ in India
			Cambridge Analytica worked “extensively” in India, and operated a system of “modern-day colonialism”, globally undermining democratic processes across the world, as Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who blew the lid on the firm’s gathering of data from Facebook told a British parliamentary committee on Tuesday.

			He told MPs that the company had worked on “all kinds of projects” in India, including regionally, and believed “their client was the Congress,” he said, adding that he believed he had documentation he could provide relating to work in India. “They do have offices there, they do have staff,” he said. “I don’t remember a national project,” he said on Tuesday. “I mean India is so big, one state could be as big as Britain,” he said in response to Labour MP Paul Farrelly.

			Cambridge Analytica controversy: Urgent need for data protection laws, say experts

			During his testimony he built a picture of the work carried out by Cambridge Analytica, and AggregateIQ (AIQ), a Canada-based company that had played a role in political processes across the world. They included particularly concerning instances of the role AIQ had played in disseminating violent video content by social media in Nigeria, as part of work there. Cambridge Analytica was an example of “modern day colonialism,” he suggested at one point.

			“This is a company that has gone around the world and undermined the democratic process,” he said. “You have a wealthy company from a developed nation going into an economy or democracy still struggling to get its feet on the ground and taking advantage of that.”

			U.S. regulator probes Facebook

			 
			Among allegations made by Mr. Wylie was the suggestion that Vote Leave, one of the main campaigns that pushed for Brexit, may have broken Britain’s electoral rules that went beyond existing concerns around spending infractions, over the role that AIQ played in the campaign.

			“This is not about leave or remain. It’s about the integrity of the democratic process,” said Mr. Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, who earlier this month, revealed details of how the firm had inappropriately gathered Facebook data used to target voters in the US, dating back to 2014, using an app developed by Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan.

			Mr. Wylie insisted, that despite his “pink hair and nose ring” he was one of the “rare breeds of progressive Eurosceptics.”

			Internal entity
			AIQ has long maintained its independence from Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group — but Mr. Wylie insisted that Aggregate IQ, while not owned by Cambridge Analytica, held the licence to the intellectual property that formed the basis of Cambridge Analytica’s software, and effectively operated as an “internal entity” that were kept at arm’s length for purposes of political expediency.

			He also described as “categorically untrue” claims that Cambridge Analytica had never used Facebook data, citing the app, which had been the “foundational dataset of the company”. Past evidence given by suspended Cambridge Analytica head Alexander Nix to the committee had been “dishonest” and “misleading”, he said.

			During a lengthy session in which MPs from across the political spectrum on the culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee quizzed Mr. Wylie, he provided a snapshot of the work carried out by the firms, currently in the spotlight, highlighting how data captured enabled them to build up psychological profiles of individuals who would be particularly susceptible to forms of certain tactics.

			During the Brexit referendum campaign, for example, rather than focussing on everyone in the country, AIQ focussed on 5 to 7 million people who were their “core” universe, blasting them with adverts in a “calculated way”. Between 5 and 7% of cases it resulted in the targeted individuals carrying out a “substantive action” for the leave campaign — highlighting the important role that AIQ’s work played in the campaign and the final result.

			Who is Alexander Nix?

			 
			Asked whether the results swayed the referendum vote he insisted that was irrelevant. If someone was caught doping in the Olympics one lost one’s medal either way. “This is a breach of the law…this is cheating this is an irreversible change to the constitutional settlement of this country.”

			Mr. Wylie’s testimony is the latest in a series of dramatic developments that brought together questions about Brexit, Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.

			“Christopher Wylie was a part-time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since that date,” Cambridge Analytica said on Tuesday, as Wylie gave testimony.

			Breaking rules
			Investigative work by the Observer newspaper, Channel 4 and The New York Times, with Shahmir Sanni, a member of the BeLeave pro-Brexit group, has alleged that Vote Leave may have broken the rules by using BeLeave as a front for spending above the allowed limit, purportedly giving the group £625,000 to funnel into Aggregate IQ.

			After the referendum, senior figures within Vote Leave had attributed some of their success to the work of the Canadian firm. Vote Leave “pretended” to give BeLeave the money, which had “no control over it,” Mr. Sanni told the Observer over the weekend.

			During his testimony, Mr. Wylie alleged that senior figures in Vote Leave had used BeLeave to “launder” money. Bindmans, a law firm, said there was sufficient evidence to suggest a criminal offence could have been committed by the campaign.

			He is still the team’s biggest draw and astonishing crowds of around 7000 people have been chanting his name at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium for CSK’s practise sessions.

			While CSK is not the youngest of sides, it has cricketers who understand the nuances of T20 cricket. Calculated bursts of aggression often prove decisive.

			Raina, Vijay key men

			Much would depend on Suresh Raina’s blitzkriegs. M. Vijay, back with the franchise, can switch gears, while Faf du Plessis lends both stability and enterprise. Kedar Jadhav is a clever little batsman who slices open attacks and Ambati Rayudu can both rotate strike and pierce gaps.

			Sam Billings powers the ball a long way. Among the all-rounders, Ravinda Jadeja can cut loose while Shane Watson and Dwayne Bravo are heavy hitters. CSK is not short of batting firepower.

			The side has some serious options in spin, for long, its strength. Jadeja can contain and strike with his quickish left-arm variety. Long-distance man Harbhajan Singh, his enthusiasm for the game has not dipped one bit, can be expected to send down his four overs with control and craft. This left-arm and off-spin combination could hurt the opposition.

			Then the two leg-spinners, the vibrant Imran Tahir, an attack-minded bowler, and the much-quieter Karn Sharma, quicker through the air, could turn games for CSK too.

			In the pace attack, Bravo’s change of pace and ability to bowl at the death will be valuable. And Mark Wood and Lungi Ngidi provide the required dash of pace. The industrious Shardul Thakur is the leading domestic paceman in the pack.

			The lion is back in the hunt.
