		    <h3>India, Pak 'mutually' agree to resolve issue of harassment of diplomats</h3>
		   <p>New Delhi: India and Pakistan on Friday mutually agreed to resolve matters related to the treatment of diplomats and diplomatic premises, a press release of the Ministry of External Affairs said.
			The two countries have decided to resolve the matter in line with the 1992 "Code of Conduct for the treatment of diplomatic/consular personnel in India and Pakistan", the release added.
			The pact laid down 12-point code of conduct regarding the way diplomats would be treated in the other country.

			The diplomatic row had taken India-Pakistan ties to new low.

			Earlier this month, India alleged mistreatment of its envoy in Pakistan and asked Islamabad to ensure safety and security of its officials working at the Indian mission in Islamabad.

			In incidents of alleged harassment, one Indian diplomat going to a restaurant in Islamabad was “aggressively” followed by some people in a car. Four Indian diplomats travelling in an official vehicle on their way to a market were also tailed by two people on a motorcycle.

			Pakistan also accused India of harassing its diplomats and released videos of alleged intimidation of its officials. It also called its High Commissioner to India back home for consultations on the issue.

			However, the Indian government said that calling back envoys for consultations is a routine process and there is nothing unusual in this.

		  <P style="font-size:12px;">
		   "What's the point in talking about prison reforms when we cannot keep them in jail. We should release them, if you cannot keep them properly," the top court said, lambasting state governments and union territories (UTs) for "complete lack of commitment" to fix this "extremely unfortunate" situation.
			A bench of Justices MB Lokur and Deepak Gupta also warned the Directors General of Police (Prisons) of all states and UTs of contempt notice for non-compliance of its earlier orders with regard to submitting a plan of action to deal with issue of overcrowding prisons.
              <img src="newspaper2/sec2.jpg" height="100px" width="100px">
			"It is unfortunate that the prisons are overcrowded. Prisoners also have human rights and they cannot be kept in jails like animals," it said.

			The court said it was informed by amicus curiae that there were a large number of jails where "overcrowding is well above 150 per cent and in one case it is as high as 609 per cent."

		  <h3>US astronauts make a spacewalk to perform ISS repairs</h3>
		  <p>
			Two American astronauts completed a lengthy spacewalk to replace old hoses on the International Space Station's cooling system and make other equipment upgrades, footage from the US space agency NASA showed.

			The walk, which lasted six hours and 10 minutes by flight engineers Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold got off to a delayed start because leak checks for one of the astronaut's space suits took longer than expected, a NASA TV commentator said.
            
			But once outside of the space station, the astronauts worked methodically and without incident to install wireless communications antennas, swap out the cooling system hoses and replace a broken video camera with a new one.

			The hoses are suspected as a possible cause of an ammonia leak from the space station's cooling system.

		 <h3>Mallikarjun Kharge, Siddaramaiah rift may prove costly in Hyderabad- Karnataka region</h3>
		 <P>
		 Ballari: Is there  trouble ahead for the Congress in Hyderabad- Karnataka in the run-up to the coming assembly poll?  It is believed that reported differences between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and senior leader, Mallikarjun Kharge over the selection of  candidates could stir rebellion in the ranks and hamper its performance in the region.
          <img src="newspaper2/sit.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
		Worried Congress insiders  say that unless the differences between Mr Kharge and the Chief Minister are resolved ahead of the assembly poll, the party is likely to suffer in many constituencies owing to internal squabbling. 

		 

		Often seen as the ‘high command’  as far as Hyderabad-Karnataka region is considered, Mr Kharge appears to be losing his hold over  decision-making in the  region.

		“In the recent selection of Rajya Sabha candidates, Kharge lobbied hard for the Ballari realtor, Reddy Veeranna, but the Congress selected the  lesser known Muslim leader , Syed Nasser Hussain from the H-K region, which is considered a setback for him,” said a senior Congress leader.

		Unfortunately for the veteran Congressman, he seems to be on a losing wicket in the coming assembly poll too as it is believed Congress MLA from Ballari, Anil Lad, a Kharge loyalist, may be denied a ticket to contest from the constituency and it could instead go to  his cousin and district in- charge minister , Santosh Lad, considered close to Mr Siddaramaiah, or granite baron and former MLA, Suryanarayana Reddy.

		 <h3>Tough Cauvery queries leave AIADMK leaders mum</h3>
		 <P>
		 Chennai: ‘Suicide fame’ AIADMK MP A. Navaneedha Krishnan had a harrowing time at the Chennai airport on Thursday with a few passengers tossing embarrassing questions related to Cauvery.

		In the background there was a voice whispering ‘When are you going to commit suicide for Cauvery’.

		 

		The AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP on Wednesday created an uproar saying all party MP’s will be driven to ‘extreme step’ if the centre continues to be delay the formation of Cauvery Management Board, while deputy chairman in the Rajya Sabha P J Kurien expunged the remarks by the MP, the MP called several TV journalists to justify the threat he made in the Rajya Sabha.

		“Yes I said all AIADMK MPs will commit suicide because that is the situation of our farmers in TN,” he told TV channels and this ‘threat’ went viral causing embarrassing situation for the former advocate general at the city airport, when he was stopped by the journalists to respond on the issue.
         <img src="newspaper2/cavery.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
		The AIADMK leader faced the first sample of the public ire for what many believed to be a mere rhetoric and waste of time. This reflected at the Meenambakkam airport, where co passengers who witnessed the press conference jumped in to the scene and started raising queries on the Cauvery issue. A passenger came forward in the press conference and started throwing a volley of uncomfortable questions to the MP asking him why he was going soft with the Centre. He also asked the MP to sit on a fast at the airport and said that the entire Tamil Nadu will follow him. He also raked up the Neet issue thus doing the job of media.

	  Its always a special feeling when you have a cricket chat with Mr Hussey. He is someone who has proved himself across formats and is called Mr Cricket for a reason. Its always good to pick his brains and learn a new sets of tricks," he was quoted as saying on chennaisuperkings.com.

 <img src="newspaper2/ipl2.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
 
The 22-year old cricketer from Coimbatore also said he sought to find out from Hussey how to go about attacking a bowler. "I asked him the way he would go about playing a bowler, especially when he wants to attack him.

"There are so many players like me who are not able to clear the boundary line at will. I have been working on that and I am looking to get a similar mentality of how he approached it," he added.

The Tamil Nadu keeper-batsman, who was picked up by CSK at his base price of Rs 20 lakh, also said he spoke to captain Dhoni during the training sessions and discussed various aspects of wicket-keeping.

 "Being picked up by CSK is really special, especially with me playing for Tamil Nadu and now playing for the Lions. We got MS Dhoni in the team and he being a legendary keeper-bat I can learn a lot from him," he said.

"I was asking him about my weak points and how he would have tackled those situations. He also spoke about how he focuses on his keeping and gave me inputs on how to get better," Jagadeesan said.

 He came through the ranks in Tamil Nadu cricket and made a mark in the Twenty20 format when he emerged as the top run-getter in the inaugural edition of Tamil Nadu Premier League in 2016 to be adjudged player of the tournament.

The 11th edition of IPL begins with a clash between CSK and defending champion Mumbai Indians in Mumbai on April 7.

	  Barcelona: Lionel Messi returned to training with Barcelona on Thursday to offer the Catalans a boost with less than a week to go before their Champions League clash against Roma.

Messi missed Argentina's two internationals over the last week due to a hamstring strain, although he did train between the 2-0 win over Italy last Friday and Tuesday's 6-1 humiliation by Spain.

 

"Messi took part in a part of training with the squad," said Barca on their Twitter account.

The 30-year-old five-time world player of the year joined other Barca stars just back from international duty.

With Barca enjoying an 11-point lead over Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, where they are unbeaten all season, Messi may be rested for Saturday's trip to Sevilla to give him more time to recover ahead of the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Roma on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had said he was feeling "calm" with regards Messi's potentially availability.

"He has a slight problem but we hope that it's not serious," he said

	  <p>
	  NEW DELHI:  The Allahabad High court today directed the UPPSC to conduct re-evaluation of the answer scripts of the PCS preliminary examination held in last September. Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) conducted this preliminary examination for recruitment in upper subordinate services for which advertisement was issued on February last year and court in is verdict today, denied to direct hold fresh preliminary examinations.

The court also said that any candidate becomes ineligible after revaluation would not be allowed to participate in the selection process.

	  <h3>Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan: Karthi on support to which superstar 'politician'</h3>
	  <p>
	  Actor Karthi seems to be emerging from his shell these days. Of late he has been quite forthcoming with his views on many subjects, other than on his films too. The Nadigar Sangam treasurer was in a cheerful mood at the shooting spot of his upcoming flick Kadai Kutty Singam with director Pandiraj and took all questions in his stride, including when asked about his take on Rajini, Kamal and Vishal entering politics.

Reacting to a query on his close pal Vishal’s entry into politics, Karthi said, "Vishal said he never started any political party.” Recalling Vishal’s words, Karthi said, “When everyone says that the youth should come to politics and remain silent, there is no meaning. So, I stood in the RK Nagar elections and realised the difficulties of politics. It is not an easy proposition even if you want to serve the society. So, I look at Vishal’s decision only that way.  The best thing about him is that he didn’t fear anyone and attempted something good. Even if he couldn’t get back his deposit money, his participation still had a significance, and I appreciate his thoughts and idea.”

 <img src="newspaper2/e1.jpg" height="400px" width="600px">

Whe we prodded him on his support to Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, and Karthi replied with a smile. “Let them come, then we will see.” However, on a serious note he said, “Yes, both the stars have already announced that they are plunging into politics. Let them announce their plans and see what they have in store for the people of Tamil Nadu. Both have earned enough money in cinema. So, the legends won’t come into politics for money. They always say that people of TN have given us so much and this is the way I give back to them. They genuinely want to do something good for people. An MLA can vanish from the scene when he loses in the next elections, whereas Rajini and Kamal being well-known will not run away and hide somewhere.” Reminiscing about how Kamal Haasan is inspired by his dad Sivakumar he said, “Kamal sir always says that he has learnt a lot from my father. He calls my dad as ‘anna’. He changed his ‘Rasigar Mandram’ as ‘Makkal Mandram’ after he was motivated by appa’s acts.”

	  <h3>Enjoy the sun and protect your skin with these tips</h3>
	  <p>
	  <img src="newspaper2/life.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
	  New Delhi: Everyone likes to enjoy the sun for these three months, but if we are not careful about our skin, we may have more regrets than pleasant summer memories.

It is that time of the year when all the swimming pools in the city are filled with people who wish to escape the burns of the sun.

 

Before you step out, ensure you have some skin protection measures in place, to make the best of the summer season.

Here are some tips by Dr. Austin, Head, R&D, Cholayil:

-A dip in the pool can beat the summer heat but it can leave a severe tan on the skin for months. Try a mixture of Multani Mitti (a mineral rich clay material) along with few drops of lemon and rose water. Mix the ingredients and apply on exposed areas after sun exposure. The soothing paste calms the skin with a cooling effect.

-The water in swimming pools contain disinfectants like iodide and chlorine, which cause skin problems like acne flare-ups, rashes and red patches over the body. Cinnamon has great anti-microbial properties Add a few drops of honey and aloe vera gel to cinnamon powder to fight against the bacteria causing acne. The mixture also keeps the skin moist.

-Turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory properties as it targets the pores and cleansing it from within. Grind neem leaves with water and mix it with one tbsp of turmeric powder as turmeric helps to reduce scars naturally. Apply the paste on the face with few drops of rose water to clear up the skin from acne breakouts.

Making the time to relax is crucial reveals Dr Megan Arroll, a chartered psychologist. "Relaxing, winding down and unplugging from our busy lives is important as it gives our bodies and minds a chance to recalibrate," she is quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.

So if you have forgotten how to take it easy or find what you're trying isn't working, here are some easy tips to get you in a relaxed mood in no time.

A Daily Mail report revealed the tips recommended by Dr Megan Arroll and Dr Jen Nash.

1. Breathe:  Breathing deeply, like a baby, can be a powerful tool to help you relax. It helps kick start the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps reduce stress. Repeat this breathing exercise at least five times a day. You can do it during a walk, or before a meal or bedtime.

2. Move your fingers: Focusing on a simple task can help rest the mind. Activities like knitting can also help put you in a sort of meditative state.

3. From top to bottom, analyse your body: In a comfortable position, notice the sensations of the weight touching the furniture or floor. As you continue this ritual, take a few breaths before you end the session.

4. Visualize you're already in a relaxed state: Visualization has the ability to take you to a state of calm.

5. Make a list: Writing down what you are worried about will help you feel better. Imagine every point you've noted floating away from your mind.

6. Cannabis oil can help put you at ease: The survey conducted in the UK found 3% of people use cannabis oil supplements to relax.

	  <h3>Drinking just 3 cups of coffee could clear out your arteries, researchers claim</h3>
	  <p>
	  A new study has found that just three cups of coffee may help clear you arteries and offer protection from heart disease, the Daily Mail reported.

A team from the University of Sao Paulo conducted the study.  For the study, the team gathered information about diet and Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) data from 4,400 participants. Participants who drank more that one cup per day were seen to have less  'calcified' arteries.

 

"In our research, we found that habitual consumption of more than three cups a day of coffee decreased odds of coronary calcification," study author Andreia Miranda told the Daily Mail.

Previous research has found coffee has a wealth of evidence. Experts believe antioxidant plant compounds could be the reason.

However, researchers warn more than three cups can be unhealthy. Further investigation is needed to understand what in coffee improves heart health.

The study was originally published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.
